# Ubuntu optimizations

Added a few tweaks and scripts to optimize the Ubuntu experience

## Important
This repository contains scripts and configs for personal use. I decided to make it public in order to help everyone have a good experience on Ubuntu, therefore this may not satisfy your specific use-case.
All recommendations are welcomed but if I can't find a personal use-case for them, I will not accept them. If you want to make your own configuration tool, I highly encourage you to fork this repo. 

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredtux/ubuntu-optimizations.git

```
